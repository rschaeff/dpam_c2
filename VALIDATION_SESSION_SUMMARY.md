# Step 13 Validation Session Summary

## Session Goal
Validate and fix Step 13 domain parsing algorithm against 15 test proteins from v1.0 reference.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. **T-group Constraint Missing (CRITICAL FIX)**

**Problem**: v2.0 was merging segments based purely on probability scores, causing inappropriate merging across domain boundaries when domains were spatially adjacent.

**Root Cause**: Algorithm lacked the v1.0 constraint that segments can only merge if they share the same structural family (T-group).

**Evidence**:
- O66611: Should produce 2 domains (D1: T-group 192.10, D2: T-group 377.1)
- v2.0 was merging into 1 domain despite high cross-boundary probabilities
- Both domains had strong template support from different T-groups

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Modified `load_good_domains()` to track T-group assignments per residue
2. Quality filtering for T-group assignment:
   - Sequence hits: probability >= 90
   - DALI hits: quality = "superb" only
3. Added dominant T-group matching:
   - `get_dominant_tgroup()`: Find most common T-group in segment
   - `segments_share_tgroup()`: Check if segments share dominant T-group
4. Enforced T-group constraint in merging:
   - `merge_segments_by_probability()`: probability > 0.54 AND same T-group
   - `iterative_clustering()`: same constraint in iterative phase

**Commit**: `831d2cf` - "Add T-group-aware segmentation to Step 13"

### 2. **Probability Matrix Default Handling (FIXED IN PREVIOUS SESSION)**

**Problem**: v2.0 wasn't filling in default HHS/DALI scores for all residue pairs.

**Solution**: Fill defaults (HHS=20, DALI=1) for ALL pairs before calculating probabilities.

**Status**: Already implemented and working.

## Validation Results

### Current Performance (5/15 = 33.3% correct domain counts)

**Correct Domain Counts**:
1. ✅ **Q9JTA3**: 1 domain (v1.0=1, v2.0=1)
2. ✅ **P47399**: 1 domain (v1.0=1, v2.0=1)
3. ✅ **C1CK31**: 1 domain (v1.0=1, v2.0=1)
4. ✅ **O33946**: 2 domains (v1.0=2, v2.0=2) ← **FIXED by T-group constraint!**
5. ✅ **Q8CGU1**: 6 domains (v1.0=6, v2.0=6)

**Over-Segmentation** (1 protein):
- **O66611**: v1.0=2, v2.0=3 (+1 domain)

**Under-Segmentation** (9 proteins):
- **Q2W063**: v1.0=2, v2.0=1 (-1)
- **B4S3C8**: v1.0=2, v2.0=1 (-1)
- **A5W9N6**: v1.0=3, v2.0=2 (-1)
- **B0BU16**: v1.0=3, v2.0=2 (-1)
- **Q5M1T8**: v1.0=4, v2.0=2 (-2)
- **B1IQ96**: v1.0=3, v2.0=1 (-2)
- **Q8L7L1**: v1.0=3, v2.0=1 (-2)
- **Q92HV7**: v1.0=7, v2.0=2 (-5)
- **P10745**: v1.0=8, v2.0=3 (-5)

### Case Study: O33946 (Success Story)

**Structure**: 379 residues, 2 domains
- D1: 1-125 (T-group 218.1 - small N-terminal domain)
- D2: 126-370 (T-group 2002.1 - TIM barrel)

**Before T-group fix**:
- Merged into 1 domain despite clear structural separation
- Cross-boundary probabilities were 0.76-0.95 (very high!)

**After T-group fix**:
- Correctly produces 2 domains
- T-group constraint prevented merging between 218.1 and 2002.1

**Visual confirmation**: PyMOL visualization shows clear domain boundary

### Case Study: O66611 (Partial Success)

**Structure**: 145 residues, expected 2 domains
- D1: 6-65 (T-group 192.10 - alpha-helical)
- D2: 66-115 (T-group 377.1 - beta-sheet)

**Template Evidence**:
- 2 "superb" DALI hits for T-group 192.10 covering 1-82
- 6 high-prob (99.5-99.85%) sequence hits for T-group 377.1 covering 80-121

**Current Result**: 3 domains (improved from 1, but still not perfect)
- Shows T-group constraint is working to prevent full merger
- Over-segments due to boundary detection issues

## Remaining Issues

### 1. **Under-Segmentation in Multi-Domain Proteins**
Most proteins with 3+ domains still show significant under-segmentation. Possible causes:
- Insufficient high-quality template coverage
- Complex domain architectures (repeats, insertions)
- May require ML pipeline (steps 15-24) for full accuracy

### 2. **Boundary Accuracy**
Even when domain counts match, boundary positions can differ by 5-10 residues. This may be acceptable variation or require further refinement.

### 3. **Quality Thresholds**
Current thresholds (prob >= 90 for sequence, "superb" for DALI) may be too strict for some cases. Could experiment with:
- Lower sequence probability threshold (85? 80?)
- Include "good" quality DALI hits?

## Algorithm Summary (Step 13 v2.0)

```
1. Load Data
   - PDB coordinates, PAE matrix, disorder predictions
   - HHsearch/DALI scores + T-group assignments (quality-filtered)

2. Calculate Probability Matrix
   - Combine: dist^0.1 * pae^0.1 * hhs^0.4 * dali^0.4
   - Fill defaults (HHS=20, DALI=1) for all pairs

3. Initial Segmentation
   - Create 5-residue chunks (excluding disorder)

4. Merge by Probability + T-group (threshold > 0.54)
   - NEW: Only merge if dominant T-groups match

5. Iterative Clustering (threshold 1.07)
   - NEW: T-group constraint enforced

6. Domain Refinement
   - Filter by length (>= 20 residues)
   - Fill gaps (<= 10 residues)
   - Remove overlaps (>= 15 unique residues)
   - Final length filter
```

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Investigate under-segmentation in multi-domain proteins
2. Consider relaxing T-group quality thresholds
3. Analyze boundary accuracy for matching domain counts

### Long Term
1. Implement full ML pipeline (steps 15-24) for ECOD assignment and refinement
2. The ML pipeline may improve segmentation through:
   - Domain merging based on ECOD template connectivity
   - SSE (secondary structure) analysis for boundary refinement
   - Confidence scoring for quality assessment

## Conclusion

The T-group constraint fix represents a **major algorithmic improvement** that successfully prevents inappropriate cross-domain merging. The constraint is working as intended when high-quality template data exists.

**Key Achievement**: O33946 now correctly segments into 2 domains, demonstrating the fix addresses the fundamental issue of spatially adjacent domains merging inappropriately.

**Remaining Challenge**: Under-segmentation persists in complex multi-domain proteins, likely requiring the full ML pipeline for optimal results.
