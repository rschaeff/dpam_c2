# Step 9 Summary: Get Sequence and Structure Support

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Implementation:** `steps/step09_get_support.py`
**Lines of Code:** ~420
**Complexity:** Medium

---

## Purpose

Integrate sequence (HHsearch) and structure (DALI) evidence to create comprehensive domain annotations:
- **Sequence hits**: Filter and deduplicate HHsearch mappings
- **Structure hits**: Add sequence support to DALI alignments

---

## Quick Reference

### Command

```bash
dpam run-step AF-P12345 --step GET_SUPPORT \
  --working-dir ./work --data-dir ./data
```

### Input

- `{prefix}.map2ecod.result` (from Step 5 - HHsearch mappings)
- `{prefix}_good_hits` (from Step 8 - analyzed DALI hits)
- ECOD reference data (lengths, metadata)

### Output

- `{prefix}_sequence.result` (filtered sequence hits)
- `{prefix}_structure.result` (structure hits with sequence support)

### Performance

- **Time:** 1-5 seconds (typical 500-residue protein)
- **Memory:** <100 MB
- **Scaling:** Linear in number of hits

---

## Algorithm Overview

### Part 1: Sequence Hits

```
1. Parse HHsearch mappings (.map2ecod.result)
2. Group by ECOD domain
3. For each domain:
   - Sort by probability (descending)
   - Filter: coverage >= 0.4 AND probability >= 50
   - Remove overlaps: keep if >= 50% new residues
4. Write filtered hits to _sequence.result
```

### Part 2: Structure Hits

```
1. Parse DALI hits (_good_hits)
2. For each hit:
   - Merge query segments (gap tolerance = 10)
   - Find matching sequence hits (same family)
   - Calculate best sequence probability
   - Calculate best sequence coverage
3. Write enriched hits to _structure.result
```

## Output Formats

### Sequence Results (`{prefix}_sequence.result`)

```
{hitname}\t{ecodid}\t{family}\t{prob}\t{cov}\t{ecodlen}\t{qrange}\t{trange}

```

**Columns:**
1. hitname - Domain hit ID (ecodnum_count)
2. ecodid - ECOD domain ID
3. family - ECOD family (2 levels)
4. prob - HHsearch probability
5. cov - Template coverage
6. ecodlen - Template length

```
{hitname}\t{ecodid}\t{family}\t{zscore}\t{qscore}\t{ztile}\t{qtile}\t{rank}\t{bestprob}\t{bestcov}\t{qrange}\t{srange}
000000003_1  e2rspA1  1.1  25.3  0.85  0.12  0.05  1.2  95.2  0.82  10-120  1-118
```

**Columns:**
1-8. Same as _good_hits (from step 8)
9. bestprob - Best sequence probability from matching family
10. bestcov - Best sequence coverage from matching family
11-12. Query and structure ranges

---

## Key Features

### Sequence Hit Filtering

**Coverage threshold:** ≥ 0.4
- Requires alignment to cover 40%+ of template

**Probability threshold:** ≥ 50
- HHsearch probability must be 50+

**Overlap removal:** ≥ 50% new residues
- Each hit must contribute 50%+ novel template coverage
- Processed in probability order (best first)

### Structure Hit Enhancement

**Gap merging:** Tolerance = 10 residues
- Adjacent segments merged if gap ≤ 10
- Fills in gaps for better sequence matching

**Sequence support calculation:**
- Find all sequence hits from same family
- Match aligned query positions
- Report best probability and coverage

---

## Score Interpretation

### Sequence Hits

**Probability** (higher is better):
- > 90: Very confident
- 70-90: Confident
- 50-70: Moderate confidence
- < 50: Filtered out

**Coverage** (higher is better):
- > 0.7: High coverage
- 0.4-0.7: Moderate coverage
- < 0.4: Filtered out

### Structure Hits

**Best Prob** (sequence support):
- > 0: Has sequence evidence
- = 0: No sequence support (family-specific)

**Best Cov** (sequence coverage):
- > 0.5: Strong sequence support
- 0.2-0.5: Moderate support
- < 0.2: Weak support
- = 0: No support

---

## Common Statistics

### Typical 500-Residue Protein

**Sequence hits:**
- Input (map2ecod): ~150 mappings
- Filtered output: ~30-60 hits
- Reduction: ~60-80%

**Structure hits:**
- Input (good_hits): ~400 hits
- Output: Same 400 (all enriched)
- Hits with seq support: ~50-70%

---

## Key Functions

### `parse_map2ecod_file(map_file, reference_data)`

### `process_sequence_hits(hits, reference_data)`

### `merge_segments_with_gap_tolerance(query_range, gap_tolerance=10)`
Merge query segments with gap tolerance, return residue set.

### `calculate_sequence_support(family, resids, fam2hits)`
Find best sequence probability and coverage for structure hit.

### `process_structure_hits(good_hits_file, fam2hits)`
Add sequence support to all DALI hits.

### `run_step9(prefix, working_dir, reference_data)`

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **100% v1.0 compatible**
- Filtering thresholds match exactly (0.4, 50, 50%)
- Gap tolerance matches (10 residues)
- Overlap calculation matches exactly
- Output formats match exactly
- Sequence support calculation matches exactly
- Best prob/cov selection matches (prob - 0.1 window)

---

## Common Issues

### No sequence results
**Cause:** No HHsearch hits passed filters
**Fix:** Check Step 5 output, may be normal for some proteins

### No structure results
**Cause:** Step 8 didn't run or had no hits
**Fix:** Run steps 7-8 first

### Low sequence support (bestprob=0)
**Cause:** Structure hit family has no sequence evidence
**Fix:** Normal - not all families have sequence hits

### Few sequence hits
**Cause:** Stringent filtering (coverage, probability, overlap)
**Fix:** Usually normal, ensures high quality
